Hello, my name is Daivee Knuckles, a newbie Software Engineer transitioning from Project Management. 
My background experience range from Construction to Film Production and Digital Content Creation. I pride myself on being a"Professional Student" as this world is ever changing and I am, fortunately, too curious to be left behind. I am currently learning Python and other complimentary skills from other fields like Data Science, AI and Machine Learning. I'm looking forward to creating a project that contributes to the great good of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
